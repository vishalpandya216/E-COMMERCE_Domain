# E-COMMERCE_Domain
Project Description:

Objective: This project focuses on predicting user behavior or outcomes in an e-commerce setting, leveraging various e-commerce-related features.

Data Preparation: Involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and dealing with missing values. Data was split into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.

Modeling: Implemented machine learning algorithms suitable for classification/regression tasks, depending on the target variable. Hyperparameter tuning and model optimization were performed to enhance performance.

Evaluation: Model accuracy and other relevant metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, etc., were used to evaluate the model's performance. Cross-validation techniques ensured the model's robustness and generalizability.
